                PERSONAL NEWS TIME! I am joining Art of Problem Solving as its
                new Chief Product Officer.{" "}
                <Link href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/">AoPS</Link> is an
                advanced math curriculum company that serves the most ambitious
                and motivated students in the world. Notably, every member of
                the United States team at the International Math Olympiad has
                been trained by AoPS. The company is mostly unknown today, but
                I’m certain it will be world-renowned in short order. I pop out
                of bed every morning buzzing with excitement for the task ahead
                of me.
              </p>
              <p>
                The frontiers of science and technology are rapidly expanding.
                Revolutions are under way in artificial intelligence,
                biotechnology, and clean energy, among many other fields. We
                need to bring as many kids as possible to these frontiers,
                making them capable of shaping the craziness unfolding around
                them.
              </p>

                How do you bring kids to the frontiers? By helping millions of
                kids fall in love with math. We’re going to make them so{" "}
                obsessed they wake up at 8 A.M. on a Saturday morning to do math
                for fun.
              </p>
              <p>
                AoPS has been quietly at work on this problem for a couple of
                decades. If you peek behind the curtain at the major AI labs,
                many of their researchers learned math with AoPS textbooks. For
                kids in elementary school, we make a comic book-style curriculum
                called <a href="https://beastacademy.com">Beast Academy</a>. Now
                it’s my job to scale up AoPS’s approach to problem solving.
              </p>
              <h4>
                AoPS shows kids hard, <em>interesting</em> problems
              </h4>
              <p>
                I first heard about AoPS from a kid who was <em>obsessed</em>{" "}
                with math. I was teaching a class at MIT, and I had a funny
                freshman student. In high school, he woke up at 4 A.M. every
                morning to do three hours of math problems before school. He did
                this because he loved it, not because his parents asked him to.
                AoPS was the company that provided the textbooks, the community,
                and the hard problems that challenged him.
              </p>
              <p>
                A few years later I met Richard Rusczyk, the founder of AoPS. He
                shared what he’d built, and I felt a special kinship and respect
                for him as a leader. As a fellow education company founder, I
                know what he’s done is really hard to do. I decided I wanted to
                join up with him.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our country’s approach to math education has been busted for a
                long time. We spend too much time on explanations and
                algorithms. When kids don’t remember those, we remediate them
                with boring practice problems.
              </p>
              <p>
                The AoPS approach is quite simple: show kids hard, interesting
                problems straight away. Nudge them with suggestions when they’re
                stuck. When they discover how rewarding it is to solve
                unfamiliar problems, they get hooked. We teach the <em>art</em>{" "}
                of problem solving, y’know?
              </p>

              <h4>A new era for AoPS</h4>
              <p>
                I am joining in the same moment as{" "}
                <Link href="https://www.benkornell.com">Ben Kornell</Link>, who
                is taking the role of CEO. We are partnering to run the company,
                and we are excellent complements; he brings a deep background in
                operations and multi-site location management, and I bring a
                deep background in technology and product development. We share
                a love for creating great learning experiences.
              </p>
              <p>
                We both feel deep gratitude and admiration to Richard, who is
                retiring as CEO and joining the board. I think he has done more
                for math education than just about anyone. I’m very excited to
                learn from him, and I will be working closely with him.
              </p>
              <h4>A new era for Andrew</h4>
              <p>
                After a few years of semi-retirement{" "}
                <Link href="/goodbye-quizlet">post-Quizlet</Link>, I was bored.
                I wanted to work on something difficult again. I wanted to put
                my experience with making learning tools back to work.
              </p>
              <p>
                AoPS is uniquely set up to create the world’s best learning
                experience. It has curriculum developers, software engineers,
                teachers, buildings, classrooms, and direct relationships with
                parents and students. If we think simple pen-and-paper is the
                best way to work on a problem, we do that. If we want kids
                working on a whiteboard together on a hard problem, we do that.
                If we want kids solving problems adaptively with an AI, we do
                that.
              </p>
              <p>
                AoPS today looks and feels a little old-school, but that masks
                an absolutely awesome learning experience. My job is to bring
                the product up to the same world-class standards as the
                curriculum we offer. I feel uniquely suited to lead AoPS in
                bringing its approach to the world.
              </p>
              <h4>We're building the team</h4>
              <p>
                AoPS has the magic of a mission-driven company. Having never
                raised venture capital, it is untainted by Silicon Valley
                nonsense. Ben and I feel a deep responsibility to retain the
                company’s sense of purpose while we grow.
              </p>
